The Tic Tac Toe game built with React.js is a classic two-player strategy game that allows players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. The game provides a user-friendly interface and an interactive experience, making it enjoyable for players of all ages.

Key Features:
1. Interactive Board: The game board is displayed as a 3x3 grid, and each cell represents a spot where players can place their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O').
2. Player Turns: The game alternates between the two players, allowing them to place their symbols on the board during their turn.
3. Winning Conditions: After each player's turn, the game checks for winning conditions. If a player successfully places three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), the game announces them as the winner.
4. Play Again: After the game ends, players can restart the game and play again.
5. User Interface: The game has a clean and intuitive user interface, featuring a button to play the game again.
